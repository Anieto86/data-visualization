## üìä About D3.js
**D3.js (Data-Driven Documents)** is a JavaScript library for manipulating documents based on data. D3 helps you bring data to life using HTML, SVG, and CSS. D3‚Äôs emphasis on web standards provides the full capabilities of modern browsers without tying yourself to a proprietary framework, combining powerful visualization components with a data-driven approach to DOM manipulation.

### Key Features of D3.js
- **Selections:** Select elements from the document and bind data to these elements.
- **Dynamic Properties:** Use data to drive dynamic properties such as position, size, and color.
- **Enter and Exit:** Handle data updates by adding or removing elements as needed.
- **Transitions:** Animate changes to the document over time.
- **Scales and Axes:** Map data values to visual properties and create axes for charts.
